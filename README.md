blog-gen
========

A hand rolled static (blog) site generator writting in clojure using [stasis](https://github.com/magnars/stasis). Inspired very heavily by [this blog post](http://cjohansen.no/building-static-sites-in-clojure-with-stasis).

The code for this project was writtin in a very hasty manner, and is currently very rough around the edges. Will be refactored (maybe)
